This is a simple implementation of an interpreter for Brainf\*ck, a simple esoteric programming language. The interpreter is written in C and is compiled using the GNU C Compiler (gcc).

Procedure to compile and run the interpreter:

1. Compile the interpreter by using `make` or `make bf` command.

2. Run the interpreter by using `./bf <filename>` command.

3. The interpreter will read the Brainf\*ck code from the file and execute it.

4. The output of the program will be printed on the terminal with the following format:

```
size: <size of given program (in bytes)>
<given BF program>
<output of the program>
```
